Feature: User Groups Filtering

    As an admin, I should be able to filter the user groups on the "Users" page.


    #AC1: Admins should be able to filter the user groups on the Users page.
    #AC2: There should be three options under the user groups dropdown menu: ALL, Librarian and Student

    #TODO: Verify that the User Group dropdown is displayed on the Users page
    #TODO: Verify that the "ALL" option is selected by default on the Users page
    #TODO: Verify that the User Group dropdown menue has "ALL", "Librarian" and "Student" options
    #TODO: Verify that clicking on the Librarian option filters the user groups to only display Librarian users
    #TODO: Verify that clicking on the Student option filters the user groups to only display Student users
    #TODO: Verify that the "ALL" option is still selected after filtering to Librarian and then back to ALL 


    #TODO: Create scenarios that cover all the acceptance criteria
